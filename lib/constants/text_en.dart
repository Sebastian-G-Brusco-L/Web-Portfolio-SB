  "CongresoAR App":
      "● Allows you to follow how each deputy and senator votes in Argentina.\n\n● The data is collected and updated through automated Python scripts from official sources.\n\n● Includes a daily legislative agenda to stay informed about ongoing debates and projects.\n\n● The development integrated various technologies and posed an exciting technical challenge.\n\n● Uses Firebase for metrics and error monitoring, ensuring efficient tracking.\n\n● Uses Google APIs to manage and display data accurately.\n\n● Congreso AR offers an accessible and transparent way to stay informed about Argentine politics.",
  "Movies App":
      "● Allows you to view the listings of the most popular and trending movies.\n\n● Utilizes an external API (TMDB) to get up-to-date information about movies.\n\n● You can access details such as synopsis, cast, genres, and release dates.\n\n● The app offers a simple and dynamic experience to explore movie options.\n\n● Firebase is used for metrics and analytics, allowing precise tracking of app usage and user behavior.\n\n● I learned a lot about making API calls to third-party services and handling real-time data.",
  "Huffman Algorithm":
      "● This project consists of implementing the Huffman algorithm for file compression and decompression using C++. The main goal of the project is to compress files to reduce their size and decompress them to restore the original file. This process is based on binary trees and frequency-based encoding of the characters in the file.\n\n● It demonstrates a practical use of the Huffman algorithm, one of the most efficient lossless compression methods. The code is optimized to compress and decompress files with different data types, using a frequency-based character encoding and binary tree construction approach.\n\n● I delved into data structures such as trees and lists, as well as advanced file handling. I implemented a custom ADT to handle complex operations on strings and files.",
  "Data Structures ADTs":
      "● This project involves creating several custom ADTs (Abstract Data Types) that implement specialized functionalities for handling strings, tokens, lists, arrays, and files. These basic modules were the foundation for building the following ADTs: Collections ADT, MultiCollections ADT, Arrays ADT, Lists ADT, Map ADT, Queue ADT, and Stack ADT.\n\n● Each of these ADTs was developed using functions and structures to optimize data structure usage and file handling. This project is aimed at creating an efficient and modular system for managing data and collections flexibly by reusing key components.\n\n● This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of C++ programming and the efficient implementation of data structures. By developing my own ADTs, I applied advanced concepts of abstraction and data organization, ensuring each structure is reusable and scalable for future projects.",
  "Web Portfolio":
      "● This project is a web portfolio that I developed using Flutter and Dart, allowing me to create a fast, attractive, and fully responsive user interface for both mobile and desktop devices. The main idea is to showcase the projects I have worked on, providing detailed information about each one and its features.\n\n● Project Gallery: Showcases the most notable projects, each with a detailed description, images, technologies used, and external links (repositories, app stores).\n\n● Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be fully adaptable to different screen sizes, offering an optimal experience on both mobile devices and desktops.\n\n● Firebase: I use Firebase to track visitor metrics and analytics, allowing me to improve the web experience. Additionally, I have integrated Firebase Crashlytics to identify any errors.\n\n● Firebase Hosting: My portfolio is hosted on Firebase Hosting, which ensures fast and secure loading, allowing visitors to efficiently access my projects."

  "Comparing Prices App":
      "● This project allows users to compare product prices across Argentina's major supermarket chains. The app facilitates real-time price searches and comparisons, helping users save time and money by choosing where to shop.\n\n● Key features include: Searching for specific products by name or barcode, grouping products for easy price comparison and related promotions, a cart to store products persistently, and supermarket filters based on location.\n\n● All information and metrics are stored and analyzed via Firebase, while product data is sourced from external APIs, ensuring that displayed prices are always up-to-date and accurate.\n\n● Throughout this project, I deepened my skills in Flutter and Dart, especially in integrating external APIs and handling real-time data. This project allowed me to tackle and solve challenges related to performance optimization in data retrieval and display, as well as to improve my skills in designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.",
  "Stock Control and Prices":
      "● This project is a desktop application developed in Java that allows basic stock control and price consultation from the Argentine government's public database (SEPA). The application is designed for small businesses that need to manage their inventory simply, keeping an up-to-date record of products and their availability."
